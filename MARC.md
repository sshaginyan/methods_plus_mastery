Hi Marc,

Our last conversation got me thinking about obtaining social media data as well as data de-identification. I want to share with you a hypothetical data pipeline on how to do this.

### Browser Automation
Playwright is an open-source browser automation framework sponsored by Microsoft, primarily designed for end-to-end testing of modern web applications. In addition to its testing capabilities, Playwright is also widely used for web scraping. By interacting with a browser's DOM events API, Playwright can efficiently collect data from web pages, including user interactions, network requests, and dynamic content.
Our goal is to replicate human traffic as accurately as possible, so all input must be representative of human behavior, not automated or machine-generated actions. We can use technologies like [Xetera/ghost-cursor]([Xetera](https://github.com/Xetera)/**[ghost-cursor](https://github.com/Xetera/ghost-cursor)**) for creating human-like mouse movement and [georgetian3/typoer]([georgetian3](https://github.com/georgetian3)/**[typoer](https://github.com/georgetian3/typoer)**) for mimicking typing on a keyboard with mistakes. 

### Prioritizing Links with LLM
You can use a local LLM to prioritize links on a page that are more likely to be valuable, based on a provided prompt. Crawlers often stop deep crawling when they reach a point of diminishing returns, meaning the value of additional data gathered becomes minimal or irrelevant. This is particularly the case if pages at deeper levels are less likely to provide meaningful or new information.
For example, you scrape 2,000 customer reviews for a product from multiple e-commerce sites and perform sentiment analysis, revealing that 70% of the reviews are positive. Despite gathering more reviews, the sentiment score stabilizes and additional data doesn't significantly impact the result.

### Data Storage
When scraping social media data, the result is typically **semi-structured** and **unnormalized**. Store this data in **BigQuery** with minimal transformations to avoid unnecessary complexity. Keeping the data in its original state makes it easier for data producers to save it directly, without the need for extensive preprocessing.

### Synthetic Data Generation
Use the **[Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)](https://sdv.dev/)** to generate synthetic data that preserves the patterns of de-identified information. SDV offers various techniques, such as **CTGAN**, **Bayesian Networks**, and **Relational Data Generation**, to achieve this. It also incorporates [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy), ensuring the synthetic data does not expose sensitive information from the original dataset. The generated synthetic data will be stored in BigQuery alongside the real data.

### Synthetic Data Validation/Evaluation
The **Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)** offers quality scores that summarize how well the synthetic data mirrors the original dataset. These scores assess key aspects such as distribution similarity, feature dependencies, and the overall preservation of data structure. Additionally, SDV includes a **Differential Privacy Evaluation**, ensuring that the synthetic data maintains privacy by safeguarding against the re-identification of sensitive information from the original data.

### Run your analytics on synthetic data
Once synthetic data is generated, you can apply your usual analytics processes just as you would with real data. A key advantage of using synthetic data is **Safe Exploration and Testing**—enabling data exploration, model development, and testing without the risk of exposing sensitive information. Synthetic data offers a secure environment for innovation and experimentation.


Notes:

Web Scraping Obfuscation
* IP rotation
* Depth-First Crawling (without skipping nodes)
* Cursor Simulation vs DOM Event API
* Input typing
* Avoiding Honey Pot Links
